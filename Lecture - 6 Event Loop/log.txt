Event Driven Programming -->
Event Occurs: An event occurs, such as a user clicking a button.
Event is Registered: The event is registered with the event loop.
Event Listener is Triggered: The event loop checks for event listeners registered for the occurred event and triggers the corresponding event listener.
Event Listener Executes: The event listener executes, performing the desired action.
