INTRODUCING TO NODEJS
QUE 1 What is NodeJS?
ANS 1 NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used by Google Chrome. NodeJS provides a set of built-in modules that make it easy to build scalable and high-performance server-side applications.

QUE 2 What is V8 JavaScript engine?
ANS 2 The V8 JavaScript engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome and NodeJS. V8 compiles JavaScript code to native machine code before executing it, which makes it very fast. It also provides features like garbage collection and just-in-time (JIT) compilation to optimize performance.

QUE 3 Feature of NodeJS
ANS 3 NodeJS is a single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It is designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections with minimal memory usage. NodeJS also provides a rich set of built-in modules that make it easy to build scalable and high-performance server-side applications.

QUE 4 What is event-driven programming?
ANS 4 Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events. In NodeJS, events are used to handle asynchronous operations, such as reading from a file or making a network request. When an event occurs, NodeJS will execute the corresponding callback function.

QUE 5 What is non-blocking I/O?
ANS 5 Non-blocking I/O is a technique used in NodeJS to handle I/O operations without blocking the main thread. In NodeJS, I/O operations are performed asynchronously, which means that the program can continue executing other tasks while waiting for the I/O operation to complete. This allows NodeJS to handle a large number of concurrent connections with minimal memory usage.
